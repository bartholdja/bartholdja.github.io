<h3>FRIDAY 28th July</h3>

<p>On Friday we will be meeting in the afternoon for a barbecue at Owen's parents' place. Gathering for drinks around 14.00, lighting the barbecue a couple of hours later.</p>
<p>We can arrange transport for those that need it. </p>

<h3>SUNDAY 30th July</h3>

<p>For those of you staying on for the day after the wedding we are organising two trips run in parallel.</p>

<p>(1) A 3-hour caving trip to the deep levels of (<a href="http://www.clearwellcaves.com" title="Clearwell Caves">Clearwell Caves</a> ).  "Deep Level visits involve walking, crawling through narrow passageways and scrambling over rocks; down to approximately 200ft underground, discovering natural and mining features along the way." You don't need to have ever done caving before, and all equipment is provided. You will need to wear old clothes and walking boots/shoes or wellies. <b>STARTING AT 10.30</b></p>

<p>(2) A trip to the fantastic Puzzlewood. "<em>The inspiration for the forests of Middle-earth in The Lord of the Rings, such as the Old Forest, Mirkwood, Fangorn or Lothlorien.</em>". It has also featured in the Star Wars films, and Dr Who. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj1JtuOJ6Tg" title="Puzzlewood">Here's a video showing the place</a>). <b>STARTING AT 11.00</b></p>

<p>After the trips we will reconvene at a local pub, (<a href="http://www.theminerssling.co.uk/" title="Miner's Arms">The Miner's Arms</a> ) for lunch. <b>We have a table for 10 booked at 14.00</b>.</p>
