<h2>Friday and Sunday Fun</h2>
<p>We will have a weekend of fun.</p>
</header>

<p>We would be delighted if you arrived a day or two early and/or stayed a day or two longer. We will organise some activities in this lovely area. We can choose to visit magical woods, ancient mines, castles, pubs, go on boat tours, walks, mountain biking, canoeing and a lot more.</p>

<h3>FRIDAY 28th July</h3>

<p>On Friday we will be meeting in the afternoon for a barbecue at Owen's parents' place. 
We can arrange transport for those with no transport.</p>

<h3>SUNDAY 30th July</h3>

<p>For those of you staying on for the day after the wedding we are organising two trips run in parallel.</p>

<p>(1) A 3-hour caving trip to the deep levels of (<a href="http://www.clearwellcaves.com" title="Clearwell Caves">Clearwell Caves</a> ).  "Deep Level visits involve walking, crawling through narrow passageways and scrambling over rocks; down to approximately 200ft underground, discovering natural and mining features along the way." You don't need to have ever done caving before, and all equipment is provided. You will need to wear old clothes and walking boots/shoes or wellies.</p>

<p>(2) A trip to the fantastic Puzzlewood. "<em>The inspiration for the forests of Middle-earth in The Lord of the Rings, such as the Old Forest, Mirkwood, Fangorn or Lothlorien.</em>". It has also featured in the Star Wars films, and Dr Who. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj1JtuOJ6Tg" title="Puzzlewood">Here's a video showing the place</a>). </p>

<p>After the trips we will reconvene at a local pub for lunch.</p>
