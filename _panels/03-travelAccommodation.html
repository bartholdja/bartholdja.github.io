<p>TRAVEL: For those flying in, the closest airport is Bristol, followed by Birmingham and Heathrow. For those coming by train, the closest train station is Lydney. We will be able to pick you up from there. Another possibility is Gloucester, from where you can take a bus. For those coming by car, we leave you to your sat nav. </p>
<p>ACCOMMODATION: We are unfortunately not able to offer you private accommodation. <a href="http://www.rocklodge.co.uk">The Rock Lodge</a> has affordable BnB rooms and self-catering apartments close to our headquarters with great views over the hilly countryside. <a href="http://forest-house.co.uk">The Forest House</a> has similar prices and distance to where we are staying, but lies in the middle of Coleford. Finally, there is also <a href="https://www.campingintheforest.co.uk/england/forest-of-dean/bracelands-campsite">Braceland campsite </a>. Please book your accommodation soon, since the area is a tourist destination, and we will be there in July.
