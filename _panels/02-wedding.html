	<h2>Wedding</h2>
	<p>Ceremony, Cinderford, Forest of Dean Registry Office, 10:30<br />
	Lunch and Coffee & Cake, The Inn at Penallt, 12:00</p>
</header>
<p>We are getting married in a simple registry office ceremony. Afterwards we will celebrate in a countryside pub. We have exclusive use of their conservatory, which opens up to a large garden overlooking the Wye Valley. After a delicious lunch, we plan to relax, enjoy the sun in the garden, go for a nice walk through the historic village, and then re-group for coffee, tea, and wedding cake in the afternoon. We can continue to sample the local draft beers and other treats from the bar as long as we like.</p>
<p>TRANSPORT We will organise transport from the registry office to the pub, and from the pub to your accommodation, closer to the date, when we have a better overview about how many people have their own means of transport.</p>
<p>DRESS CODE Please wear whatever you like. Something smart is nice, but not necessary.</p>
<p>PRESENTS We appreciate that you are joining us to celebrate our wedding. That is all we want (i.e. no presents please!).</p>
