	<h2>The Wedding</h2>
	<p>Cinderford, Forest of Dean Registry Office, 10:30<br />
	Lunch and Coffee & Cake at Pub</p>
</header>
<p>We are getting married in a simple registry office ceremony. Afterwards we will celebrate with a joint lunch in a countryside pub. We have exclusive use of their conservatory, which opens up to a large garden overlooking the Wye Valley. After enjoying a delicious meal, we plan to relax, enjoy the sun in the garden, go for a nice walk through the historic village, and then re-group for coffee, tea, and wedding cake in the afternoon. We will enjoy the each others company and the local draft beers and other treats from the bar as long as we like.</p>
