<p>We are getting married in a simple registry office ceremony. Afterwards we will celebrate in a countryside pub. We have exclusive use of their conservatory, which opens up to a large garden overlooking the Wye Valley. After a delicious lunch, we plan to relax, enjoy the sun in the garden, go for a nice walk through the historic village, and then re-group for coffee, tea, and wedding cake in the afternoon. Following the wedding procedures, we will continue to sample the local draft beers and other treats from the bar as long as we like.</p>
<p>TRANSPORT: We will organise transport from the registry office to the pub and from the pub to your accommodation closer to the date, when we have a better overview about how many people have their own means of transport.</p>
<p>DRESS CODE: Please wear whatever you prefer. Something festive is nice, but not necessary.</p>
<p>PRESENTS: We appreciate that you are joining us to celebrate our wedding. That is honestly all we want (i.e. no presents!).</p>
<p>ADRESSES: Ceremony at Belle Vue Centre, 6 Belle Vue Rd, Cinderford GL14 2AB, UK;

<p>PARKING: We will investigate the parking situation at the registry office closer to the time. Check back in here for updates. The pub has a large car park.</p>
