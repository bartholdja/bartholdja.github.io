	<h2>noun : {the act of placing two or more things side by side}</h2>
	<p>Hello and welcome! My name is Julia Barthold and I am a 
	postdoc at the <a href="http://www.sdu.dk">University of Southern Denmark</a>. While my 
	background is in biology and mathematical demography, my interests 
	span from positive psychology to big data computing. As a result my work intersects human demography, behaviour, 
	and the development of statistical tools. I also build mathematical representations of real-world systems to answer "what would be if" questions.<p>
	<p>In this space I share things, thoughts, and tools--side by side.<p>
