	<h2>noun : {the act of placing two or more things side by side}</h2>
	<p>Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet! My name is Julia Barthold and I am a postdoc at the <a href="http://www.sdu.dk">University of Southern Denmark</a>. My interests have always been diverse and as a result my work intersects human demography, behaviour, and ecology. For finding answers, I use mathematical representations of real-world systems and statistics to coax information from data.<p>
	<p>I created this space to share things, thoughts, and tools side by side.<p>
