	<p>Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet. My name is Julia Barthold and I am a postdoc at the [University of Southern Denmark](http://www.sdu.dk). My work intersects human demography, behaviour, and ecology. I use mathematical representations of real-world systems and statistics to understand the story hidden in data sets.<p>
	<p>This space allows me to put things and thoughts side by side.<p>
